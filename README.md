# Assignment

We need to construct a responsive site following PWA specifications using `Vite, React Typescript, and ESLint` as a test assessment.

## Requirements
- Made with: Vite, React, Typescript, and EsLint
- Page navigation (minimum 2 pages) with URL parameter and query management is a plus
- Toast-based notification system (no library is a plus). It may include UI elements triggering them (add more than one toast type).
- API call (choose any free API on the internet) with response (success/error) management to inform the state to the user and display received data
- Git/GitHub knowledge
- Basic UI/UX for user-friendliness

## Constraints:
- React.Context or Redux for global state management is not allowed.
- Use pure CSS, no SASS, Tailwind, or similar tools.
